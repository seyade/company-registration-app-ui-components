##Usage

1. Go to your terminal/command window.
2. Type `npm install` or `npm i` to intall all npm dependencies.
3. And then run `npm run serve`. This should open the browser with the site displayed.
4. You can copy past the code for integration as you usually do.

I haven't found a way to split the code into their own compiled css file yet! No time for that but still working on that whenever I get small time.

Also this should be good enough to start integrating. Not all components will be 100% there, like the `progress-bar` as it will take some time to do animation, etc.
But I'll be adding as we go along.
